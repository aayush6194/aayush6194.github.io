# Building Modern Web Applications with React

Modern web development has evolved significantly over the years. React has emerged as one of the most popular libraries for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started

First, let's create a new React application:


`npx create-react-app my-modern-app`
cd my-modern-app
npm start


# JavaScript Code Example

Here's a JavaScript code block:

```javascript
const calculateSum = (arr) => {
  return arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
};

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(calculateSum(numbers)); // Output: 15
```
## Key Concepts

### 1. Component Structure

React components should be:
- Small and focused
- Reusable
- Easy to test

### 2. State Management

Modern React apps have several options for state management:
- useState for local state
- Context API for shared state
- Redux for complex state

## Code Examples

Here's a simple functional component:

<CodeBlock language="jsx">
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our app!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
</CodeBlock>

## Best Practices

1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Follow the DRY principle

## Summary

By following these patterns and practices, you can build maintainable and scalable React applications.
